## Learning Objectives/Goals

Students will learn to interpret, trace, identify and create python code that uses:

|Concept|Explanation|Python Code|Examples|
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
|Output|The computer communicates information to the user.  In this course, we use 'print' to output text to the console.|print("Text goes here")|print("Hello World!")|
|Strings|The text data type. All string data is treated as text, even if it is numerical characters.|"string goes here"| "This is a string"|

## Slide Deck

## TEACHER NOTES

These activities teach student how to use the 'print' statement to create output.

This is not an entire lesson in itself - it works alongside the other output activities to take students throught the whole PRIMM framework.

### Main Task
To solve the basic task students should use multiple print statements.  

They may assume that pressing enter in the code does this automatically - question them or demo code from a student who has done this to turn this misconception into a learning point.

### Extension Task 1
To solve extension task 1, students should use the \n command inside the string every time they want a new line.

### Extension Task 2
To solve extension task 1, students should use two print statements with a time.sleep() command between them.  This helps embed an understanding of **sequence**.

## PRIMM Task - Make

In the **make** tasks, students use the skills learned in the earlier stages of PRIMM to create their own program based on a description of what it should do.

Make sure that the students add comments to explain what the code does.

## Misconceptions/Errors to Watch Out For

- print has a capital P
- Missing brackets before/after the string
- Missing speech marks at the beginning/end of text
- Pressing enter inside the string code creates a new line
