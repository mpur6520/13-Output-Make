#This code outputs a joke statement using the print statement; also prolongs the answer
#and has ways to print the whole statement in one line using escape characters


#joke w/ extension task 2
input("Would you like to hear a joke :) ? ")
print("What is the best thing about Switzerland?\n")
import time
time.sleep(1) #extension task 2 - prolongs next print statement by 1s
print("Not sure, but the sign is a very big plus. :)")
time.sleep(2)
print("\nIsn't that funny :)\n")
time.sleep(2)
print("It is very funny.\n")
time.sleep(3)

#extension task 1 - all in one line
input("\nDo you want to hear another joke? (You're hearing one anyway): ")
print("\nWhat do you call a fake noodle?\nIt's an impasta. :)")
